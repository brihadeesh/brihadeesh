## What does _peregrinator_ mean?

_Peregrinator_ refers to one of two things, both of which I had in mind
while selecting the name. I had initially wanted to go with
Lammergeier (the German name for the [Bearded Vulture](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/lammer1/cur/introduction)) but then it was
taken on most platforms. _Peregrinator_ is the subspecies name for the
Shaheen Falcon (_[Falco peregrinus peregrinator](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/perfal/cur/systematics#subsp)_ â€” you might have to
scroll down here.) It is a beautiful falcon with a dark back and
upper-wings, a white throat, and vivid rufous underparts. It has a
typical dark "helmet" as seen in the photo. Juveniles have incomplete
hemlets and are a paler shade of rufous. Shaheen Bagh also happens to
be the name of the place chosen by the people protesting the unjust
implementation of the CAA and NRC in 2019. The word _peregrinator_
itself comes from Latin and is synonymous with [traveller or wanderer](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peregrinator). You can see read my blog at [peregrinator.site](https://peregrinator.site/)

## About me

I'm a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat person who sometimes
cosplays as an ecologist. I'm big on F(L)OSS and currently run a [Void
Linux](https://voidlinux.org) installation with a manually compiled version of Emacs 29. I
also play the guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to
make my own music occasionally. I currently use [Ardour 7.0](https://ardour.org) for audio
production, which I'm very new to, and hope to get started with the
[Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) as both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for
instruments I don't play myself. I also travel a lot for work and end
up visiting a lot of new places while I'm working. I will be starting
working on maintaining a log of that too sometime soon on this
blog. Especially the birding reports with links to eBird checklists
since I'm in the habit of maintaining them.

I have a cat at home and she's called Goose V. Goose the Fifth since
there have been four "Geese" before her. She's predominantly a stray
that just comes and hangs out at our place, but I hope to adopt her
soon. She loves to be indoors, especially in the winters since
it gets cold and she needs additional warmth. She doesn't mind jumping
up next to me on the chair or on the bed even. At night sometimes, she
even likes to sleep next to me. She's a talkative cat and often gets
very aggressive with the head bumps and the purring. She does get quite loud
too at times, especially when I per her on her lower back, which she
loves, incidentally. Occasionally, shes so calm that she lets me
scratch her belly too, and this is rare apparently.
